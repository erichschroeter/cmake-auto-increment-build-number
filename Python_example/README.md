A simple example to use a Python script to generate a C/C++ source file.

**NOTE:** Currently does not work, but will update this when/if I do get this working.

# Synopsis

Use `config.json` to store data that `generate.py` will use to generate C/C++ source files (including `.h`, `.c`, `.cpp`, etc) which will then be used in `src/main.c`.
